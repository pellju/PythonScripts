# PythonScripts

This project contains Python scripts (ast least for now) which I have been written mostly for myself.
These are (and probably will be) simple because I want to save these for future usage.


## Scripts:
moveRaws.py - Used for copying wanted RAW-images to a separate directory. List has been taken from names of jpeg files shot (the images I take are saved as CR2 and JPEG).
